I'm a young graduate in electrical engineering and industrial IT. I'm really into infosec and networking, and I spend a lot of my free time coding or reading tech-related stuff.

You can find some of my projects [here](https://github.com/eze-kiel?tab=repositories).

# Skills
* **Dev** (c, golang, some bash and python stuff)
* **Linux environements** (Ubuntu/Debian, Kali, Arch)
* **Electronics**
* **Networking** (Modbus, Ethernet & TCP/IP, I2C, SPI)

# Projects examples
[A command line interface to communicate with LG TVs](https://github.com/eze-kiel/LG-TV-command-line-interface) - *.go*

[A small script to encrypt folders using GPG](https://github.com/eze-kiel/vanish) - *.sh*

[A RPN calculator](https://github.com/eze-kiel/rpyn) - *.py*

# Hobbies
Outside IT, I like to hike, ride my bike and climb. I also love to carry heavy things in cold places : I did a solo winter expedition in the Arctic for 20 days, alone and in autonomy in 2020.
